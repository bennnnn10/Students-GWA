# Student with highest GWA

Write a Python program that read a file containing the name of 20 students together with their GWA. The program will outputs the name of the student who got the highest GWA (including the GWA).

## Program Sequence

- Set the initial lowest GWA value to 5.0.
- Create an empty list to hold the name(s) of the student(s) with the highest GWA.
- Open the txt file in read mode.
- Loop through each line in the file.
- Split the line into student name and GWA, then convert the GWA to float.
- Check if the current GWA is lower than the current lowest GWA.
- If so, update the lowest_GWA and highest_student variables.
- Then, print the outcome.
